## 🔧 **GOOGLE PLACES STORAGE STRATEGY (RECOMMENDED):**

### **✅ SMART HYBRID APPROACH:**

#### **Store Locally (Efficient):**

```json
{
  "google_places": {
    "place_id": "ChIJ...",
    "name": "Blue Bottle Coffee",
    "address": "123 Main St, Miami FL",
    "rating": 4.5,
    "user_rating_count": 1250,
    "price_level": 2,
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "website": "https://bluebottlecoffee.com",
    "photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...",
    "types": ["cafe", "food", "establishment"],
    "opening_hours": ["Monday: 7:00 AM – 7:00 PM", "..."],
    "last_updated": "2025-08-14T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

#### **Fetch On-Demand (Dynamic):**

- ❌ `currently_open` status (changes hourly)
- ❌ Latest reviews (change daily)
- ❌ Live popularity data (changes constantly)

#### **Cache Strategy:**

- **Basic Info**: 30 days (name, address, phone)
- **Photos**: 7 days (photo URLs can change)
- **Reviews**: 1 day (reviews change frequently)
- **Hours**: 1 day (can change for events/holidays)

## 📸 **PHOTO PROBLEM - SOLVED:**

### **❌ OLD SYSTEM:**

- Random stock images (surfboard girl, cars, etc.)

- **Consistent results** for same businesses
- **Intelligent fallbacks** when no photos available

### **How It Works:**

1. AI generates adventure with `business_name`
2. Google Places Text Search finds exact business
3. Place Details API gets comprehensive data
4. Photos API returns direct, stable URLs
5. Frontend displays real business photos
