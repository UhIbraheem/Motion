# Motion Web App - Comprehensive Analysis & TODO List

## ðŸš¨ FIXED: Critical Issues

### âœ… Google OAuth Loading Screen Issue

- **Problem**: OAuth callback used `window.location.href` with 1s delay causing infinite loading
- **Solution**: Changed to `router.replace('/')` for proper Next.js navigation
- **File**: `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`

### âœ… Sign In/Sign Up Image Alignment

- **Problem**: Images weren't flush with left edge due to `-ml-px` class
- **Solution**: Removed negative margin, improved padding and positioning
- **Files**: `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`, `src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`

### âœ… Route Protection Middleware

- **Added**: Middleware to protect routes and handle auth redirects
- **File**: `src/middleware.ts`
